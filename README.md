# RFID Card Data Visualiser

## Project Overview
This project consists of a system for reading and visualising data from MIFARE RFID cards using an Arduino, a client-side application, and a server to handle data communication. The aim is to demonstrate the structure and security of MIFARE cards.

The Arduino folder consists of code that runs the Arduino and its module. Best run it on the Arduino IDE.
